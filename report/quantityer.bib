	abstract = {Discover the right way to code in Python. This book provides the tips and techniques you need to produce cleaner, error-free, and eloquent Python projects. Your journey to better code starts with understanding the importance of formatting and documenting your code for maximum readability, utilizing built-in data structures and Python dictionary for improved maintainability, and working with modules and meta-classes to effectively organize your code. You will then dive deep into the new features of the Python language and learn how to effectively utilize them. Next, you will decode key concepts such as asynchronous programming, Python data types, type hinting, and path handling. Learn tips to debug and conduct unit and integration tests in your Python code to ensure your code is ready for production. The final leg of your learning journey equips you with essential tools for version management, managing live code, and intelligent code completion. After reading and using this book, you will be proficient in writing clean Python code and successfully apply these principles to your own Python projects. What You{\textquoteright}ll Learn Use the right expressions and statements in your Python code Create and assess Python Dictionary Work with advanced data structures in Python Write better modules, classes, functions, and metaclassesStart writing asynchronous Python immediatelyDiscover new features in Python Who This Book Is ForReaders with a basic Python programming knowledge who want to improve their Python programming skills by learning right way to code in Python.},

	abstract = {In recent years, GitHub has become the largest code host in the world, with more than 5M developers collaborating across 10M repositories. Numerous popular open source projects (such as Ruby on Rails, Homebrew, Bootstrap, Django or jQuery) have chosen GitHub as their host and have migrated their code base to it. GitHub offers a tremendous research potential. For instance, it is a flagship for current open source development, a place for developers to showcase their expertise to peers or potential recruiters, and the platform where social coding features or pull requests emerged. However, GitHub data is, to date, largely underexplored. To facilitate studies of GitHub, we have created GHTorrent, a scalable, queriable, offline mirror of the data offered through the GitHub REST API. In this paper we present a novel feature of GHTorrent designed to offer customisable data dumps on demand. The new GHTorrent data-on-demand service offers users the possibility to request via a web form up-to-date GHTorrent data dumps for any collection of GitHub repositories. We hope that by offering customisable GHTorrent data dumps we will not only lower the "barrier for entry" even further for researchers interested in mining GitHub data (thus encourage researchers to intensify their mining efforts), but also enhance the replicability of GitHub studies (since a snapshot of the data on which the results were obtained can now easily accompany each study).},

	abstract = {The use of automatic static analysis has been a software engineering best practice for decades. However, we still do not know a lot about its use in real-world software projects: How prevalent is the use of Automated Static Analysis Tools (ASATs) such as FindBugs and JSHint? How do developers use these tools, and how does their use evolve over time? We research these questions in two studies on nine different ASATs for Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and Python with a population of 122 and 168,214 open-source projects. To compare warnings across the ASATs, we introduce the General Defect Classification (GDC) and provide a grounded-theory-derived mapping of 1,825 ASAT-specific warnings to 16 top-level GDC classes. Our results show that ASAT use is widespread, but not ubiquitous, and that projects typically do not enforce a strict policy on ASAT use. Most ASAT configurations deviate slightly from the default, but hardly any introduce new custom analyses. Only a very small set of default ASAT analyses is widely changed. Finally, most ASAT configurations, once introduced, never change. If they do, the changes are small and have a tendency to occur within one day of the configuration's initial introduction.},
